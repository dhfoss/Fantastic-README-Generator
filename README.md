### Description
This is a command line application that dynamically generates a README.md file for a GitHub project using user input gathered with inquirer.js. It automatically formats the file with a title, table of contents (that can be clicked to jump to different sections), and the following sections: Description, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.  It also includes a license badge, and a link to the user's GitHub page.

### Installation
This app uses inquirer.js.  Run `npm install` to access it.

### Usage
To use the app, run `node index.js` in the command line. This will begin a series of questions about the project that will be filled in to the final README.md document.
